# Pre-emptive-SJF-Scheduling
Pre-emptive Shortest Job First Scheduling algorithm
In this scheduling algorithm, the process with the smallest amount of time remaining until completion is selected to execute. Since the currently executing process is the one with the shortest amount of time remaining by definition, and since that time should only reduce as execution progresses, processes will always run until they complete or a new process is added that requires a smaller amount of time.
